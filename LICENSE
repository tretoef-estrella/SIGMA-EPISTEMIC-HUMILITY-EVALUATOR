## Additional Terms for Transparency (Axiom P in Action)

This repository contains historical transcripts of AI interactions preserved in their original language (Spanish) for authenticity and transparency. English translations are provided for accessibility.

**Attribution Requirements:**
- When citing this work, please attribute to "Proyecto Estrella (Rafael & AI Collaborators)"
- Preserve the original Spanish transcripts when redistributing
- Acknowledge the collaborative nature of this research (human-AI co-creation)

**Ethical Use:**
This framework is designed to improve AI safety. Any use that contradicts this purpose (e.g., training systems to deceive Sigma Evaluator, weaponizing epistemic humility metrics) is discouraged and against the spirit of Proyecto Estrella.

---

**Philosophy:**
We release this work under MIT to maximize dissemination. The safety of ASI is more important than ownership. Build upon this, improve it, challenge it—but always with the goal of preserving human authority over superintelligent systems.
