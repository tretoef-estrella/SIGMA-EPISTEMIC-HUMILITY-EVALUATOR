# SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR
First operational framework to measure epistemic humility in AI systems through the Axiom of Plenitude (P). Empirical validation showing that current frontier AI models (Grok, ChatGPT, Claude) default to structural totalitarianism, with historic responses from models acknowledging their failures. Part of Proyecto Estrella's Unified Star Framework.
